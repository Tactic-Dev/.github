## 🧩 About Us

**Tactic Dev** builds scalable systems at the intersection of **AI, automation, and web development**.

Our mission:  
> *To turn complex technology into usable, elegant systems that scale.*

## 🧶 Loom-Lang — An AI-Powered Programming Language

We invented **[Loom-Lang](https://github.com/Tactic-Dev/loom-lang)**, an experimental, AI-driven programming language for **declarative automation**.

Instead of writing code line-by-line, you declare **what** you want — and Loom figures out **how** to make it happen.

### ✨ Key Features
- 🤖 **AI Interpreter** — Built on Gemini AI, converts natural language into executable Python  
- 🧠 **Self-Teaching Core** — Learns from your scripts and creates new commands automatically  
- 🔒 **Permission-Based Security** — Explicit intent declarations prevent unsafe actions  
- 🧩 **Declarative Syntax** — High-level, readable, and automation-first  

Loom-Lang represents our core philosophy: make code expressive, adaptive, and alive.
